          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            The Papa Imposter Rube Goldberg Project is a machine thats feeds a
            pet some pizza. In the end the biggest marble knocks down the
            support for the pizza, so the bottom part of the box falls down.
            This causes the pizza box to open allowing a pet to eat it. The
            theme of our Rube Goldberg machine is Among Us. This is the theme
            because, to start the imposter gets ejected into space with some
            stars in the background. In our project a marble representing the
            imposter gets launched into a blanket with stars on its background.
            This Rube Goldberg machine also has many energy transformations. The
            energy lost is very minimal. Looking at the difference in energies,
            we can see that the energy lost is very minimal, which was mainly
            due to some very minimal friction and sound. The difference is only
            \(0.001 \mathrm{J}\), which is very tiny, meaning that this machine
            conserves energy well. Now, is this a good thing or not? The point
            of a Rube Goldberg machine is for it to be over-the-top and take a
            lot of time and energy for it to function, and do the task that
            could’ve been done with less energy, less energy loss, and less
            time. This Rube Goldberg machine that we’ve built does this with
            minimal energy loss, takes a moderate amount of time, and doesn’t
            require much energy. So, from a Rube Goldberg standpoint, the
            \(0.001 \mathrm{J}\) loss and \(6.08\, \mathrm{s}\) time is a bad
            thing, because it is not losing enough, but from an efficiency
            standpoint, it is effective, with minimal losses, minimal time, and
            minimal initial energy needed. To improve the efficiency of the
            machine, remove the cardboard and use a more smooth surface that
            would cause less friction, which would keep the energy the same.

          <ul id="steps">
            <li>Step 1: The small marble get launched by a Catapult.</li>
            <li>
              Step 2: The marble hits the blanket and falls down through a
              tunnel towards the Dominos.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 3: The Dominos get hit each other and get taller each time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 4: The tallest Domino hits a big marble and it rolls down a
              ramp.
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 5: The marble rolls off the ramp and hits a counterweight
            </li>
            <li>
              Step 6: The counterweight falls and the pizza box opens in front
              of the pet.

          <h2>Calculations</h2>
          <p>
            We used a meter stick to measure the heights for the gravitational
            potential energy (\(GPE\)), which had no kinetic energy (\(KE\)) at
            the time, meaning that was all the energy. We used a scale to
            measure the weights (\(m\)). We used the equation \(GPE = m \cdot g
            \cdot h\) to figure out the \(GPE\), which was the mechanical energy
            (\(ME\)) because of the reasoning before. To find when it was
            moving, we found the height (\(h\)). The height was on the table, so
            it was \(0\, \mathrm{m}\). Using the potential energies
            (\(PE_{\text{before}}\) and \(PE_{\text{after}}\)), we subtracted
            them to find the work (\(W\)) applied by friction, sound, and more:
            \(W = PE_{\text{before}} - PE_{\text{after}}\). Using this, we
            calculated the final \(PE\) because we knew that no energy was lost
            between them, as dominos do not have any loss, other than very
            minimal air resistance. Finally, the power calculations were done
            with the equation \(P = \frac{W}{t}\) where \(P\) is power in watts,
            \(W\) is work in joules, and \(t\) is time in seconds.
          </p>
          <p><b>Energy</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Height = \(19\, \mathrm{cm}\) - start of the end ramp (\(GPE\))
              <p>
                \[ GPE = m \cdot g \cdot h \\ GPE = (0.19\, \mathrm{m}) \cdot
                (9.81\, \mathrm{m/s^2}) \cdot (0.101\, \mathrm{kg}) \\ GPE =
                0.188\, \mathrm{J} \]

              (\(GPE\))
              <p>
                \[ GPE = m \cdot g \cdot h \\ GPE = (0.28\, \mathrm{m}) \cdot
                (9.81\, \mathrm{m/s^2}) \cdot (0.068\, \mathrm{kg}) \\ GPE =
                0.187\, \mathrm{J} \]
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Height = \(0\, \mathrm{cm}\) - On the ground rolling (\(KE\))
              <p>
                \[ GPE + W = KE \\ KE = 0.187\, \mathrm{J} + 0\, \mathrm{J} \\
                KE = 0.187\, \mathrm{J} \]
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marbles experience no friction, and if
            any occurs, it is a negligible amount, which is reasonable.
          </p>
          <p><b>Work</b></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We calculated work from before the catapult
            launched the smaller marble to when the big marble is at the end of
            the ramp.
          </p>
          <p>
            \[ W + PE_i + KE_i = PE_f + KE_f \\ W + 0\, \mathrm{J} + 0\,
            \mathrm{J} = 0.094\, \mathrm{J} + 0.94\, \mathrm{J} \\ W = 0.188\,
            \mathrm{J} \\ d = 0.185\, \mathrm{m} \\ \frac{W}{d} = N \\ N =
            \frac{0.188\, \mathrm{J}}{0.185\, \mathrm{J}} \\ N = 1.0162\,
            \mathrm{N} \]
          </p>
          <p><b>Power</b></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We calculated power from the same part of
            the machine as the work, which is why we used the same work value as
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            \[ P = \frac{W}{t} \\ P = \frac{1.0162\, \mathrm{N}}{6.08\,
            \mathrm{s}} \\ P = 0.16713\, \mathrm{W} \]
